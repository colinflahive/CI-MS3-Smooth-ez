# Project Overview

With people leading a far busier life these days a lot of people tend to skip a lot of nutrition in their
diet as a result of not having enough time.  Consumption of smoothies that come in all forms of ingredients
allows individuals to pack as much healthy food in to their diet in the shortest period of time.

"Smooth-ez" is a smoothie recipe website for individuals who seek to maximise the healthy benefits of fruit
and vegetables in the form of quick and easy drink that can be consumed on the go. This webiste will allow
individuals to search for inspiration from other users around the world in addition to posting their own recipes
for other members to use.

# UX

### Strategy Plane

-   "Smooth-ez" will provide a forum for users to come view a variety of healthy recipes already logged to the site.  They will have the 
ability then to register and create an account on the site to add and edit their own recipes.  There will be a function for users to save
recipes which will provide them with a resource to extract and save the recipes on the site that appeal to them.

### Scope Plane

-   The objective of the Smooth-ez site is to keep content minimal at the start to avoid or minimise scope creep and stick to the fundamental
purpose of what the site is for.  The site will be simplistic in it's layout and easy to navigate.  When users choose to upload their own submissions
they will not be overwhelmed with content and will also have the option to include a url with an image of their drink.
