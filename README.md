# Project Overview

With people leading a far busier life these days a lot of people tend to skip a lot of nutrition in their
diet as a result of not having enough time.  Consumption of smoothies that come in all forms of ingredients
allows individuals to pack as much healthy food in to their diet in the shortest period of time.

"Smooth-ez" is a smoothie recipe website for individuals who seek to maximise the healthy benefits of fruit

# UX

### Strategy Plane

-   "Smooth-ez" will provide a forum for users to come view a variety of healthy recipes already logged to the site.  They will have the 
ability then to register and create an account on the site to add and edit their own recipes.  There will be a function for users to save
recipes which will provide them with a resource to extract and save the recipes on the site that appeal to them.

### Scope Plane

-   The objective of the Smooth-ez site is to keep content minimal at the start to avoid or minimise scope creep and stick to the fundamental
purpose of what the site is for.  The site will be simplistic in it's layout and easy to navigate.  When users choose to upload their own submissions
they will not be overwhelmed with content and will also have the option to include a url with an image of their drink.

### Structure Plane

-   The site is laid in an manner where the user the user will find ease of access to content with the Navbar placed across the top of each page
with the Home, Categories, Login and Register Options.  The Categories menu will expand to allow the user to select an option they are looking for
from Fruit, Vegetable, Dairy and Hot & Cold recipes.  The layout of the site should be intuitive, so it will lead the user to the options they
are looking for.  There is a Search function on the Home and Category pages to allow users to narrow the choices they wish to browse for if needs
be. The imagery and content of the site will flow in a consistent format so the user will have an understanding where they are at all times.

### Skeleton Plane

-   The content of the site allows users to progressively work their way through the content from the Homepage they can either Register as a 
new user or login where they will be able to then select a specific category of smoothie they are searching for. They will also have the ability
to enter and update their own recipes to make a contribution to the site.  In order to minimise users being overwhelmed with content, there will
be a filter feature in order for users select just the recipes they wish to keep.  Attached is the Wireframe model of what the finished website
will look like (click **[here](readme-wireframes.md)**  * * * * * INSERT WIREFRAME DOC HERE * * * * * the document will be reviewed throughout
the project to review the navigation flow and to confirm if anything has been left out or whether anything needs to be removed or edited.

### Surface Plane

-   The selection of color, font and imagery was done in a way so that it projected a subtle feeling of health and wellbeing that is why the
color of green was used.

#### Color Scheme

-   Colors were selected specifically to portray vibrant and healthy lifestyle engaging the user to browse the site for all content rather than
just a particular category they may prefer.

************************INSERT IMAGE OF COLOR PALETTE HERE FROM COOLORS.COM**************************

#### Typography

-   The Google Fonts library was used for the content of the site with the following fonts selected:
    1. The "Finger Paint" option was used for the heading for an artistic look which will catch the users eye.
    2. The "Merriweather" font was used for the main content of the site for it's neutral display and to avoid any confusion for the user.
